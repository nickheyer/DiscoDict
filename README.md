# DiscoDict
A friendly and useful Dictionary-Discord bot!

To search a definition, type "!dict 'word goes here without quotes'", if the word is not searchable, or does not exist ~ returns a google link of said word. 

To see the last definition, type "!last def". 

To install and run the bot, you need to create a new application via (https://discord.com/developers/applications). Once you have a TOKEN provided to you by discord, you can replace "INSERT DISCORD API TOKEN HERE" (check the beginning of DiscoDict.py) with your token. You will also need an API token from (https://dictionaryapi.com/register/index) which you will replace "INSERT DICTIONARY API TOKEN HERE" with, this provides access to the dictionary API. 

Have any questions, contact me on discord! ~ NastyNick#4212
